## About

**Doro** is a minimalist **Pomodoro timer** made for Apple Watch.  
It looks simple on the surface. Just a dial and some haptics. However, under the hood it handles some neat challenges like:

- **Real-world timing**  
  Instead of incrementing a counter, the timer is tied to actual wall clock time. That means it stays accurate even if you close the app or your watch goes to sleep.

- **Saving and recovering state**  
  If the user quits the app, Doro picks up where you left off by storing timer info in `UserDefaults` and reconciling with the current time when relaunched.

- **Smart haptics**  
  If your watch is locked, the system notification handles the alert. If you‚Äôre in the app, Doro runs its own repeating buzz until you dismiss it.

- **Digital Crown interaction**  
  You can adjust session length with the crown, and if you change it while the timer‚Äôs running, Doro resets things cleanly.

## Features

- ‚è≤Ô∏è **25/5 Pomodoro defaults** (focus & break), but you can tweak the minutes.  
- üéØ **Clean circular progress dial** with colors chosen on purpose:  
  - **Green** for breaks ‚Üí psychologically tied to relaxation and recovery.  
  - **Blue** for focus ‚Üí known to promote calm concentration and productivity.  
- üîî **Local notifications** for when you‚Äôre not in the app.  
- üí• **Haptics** that feel native to the wrist.  
- üåô **Quick toggle** between focus and break.  
- üïí **Automatic switching** between sessions when one finishes.

## How It‚Äôs Built

- **SwiftUI** powers the entire interface with a single source of truth for layout and state.  
- A central `TimerViewModel` (`ObservableObject`) drives all the logic, separating UI from core behavior.  
- **NotificationCenter hooks** handle background/foreground transitions so haptics and notifications never overlap.  
- **Bindings** ensure the Digital Crown adjusts time smoothly and resets timers to avoid unexpected behavior.  
- **Intentional design choices** (colors, haptics, gestures) keep the app simple but give it personality, avoiding the overstimulating UI of other apps.  

None of this is rocket science, but the small details add up: Doro is reliable, feels good to use, and doesn‚Äôt get confused if the app quits or the watch locks.
